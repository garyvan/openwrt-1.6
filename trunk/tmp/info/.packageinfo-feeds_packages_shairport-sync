Description:   Shairport Sync plays audio from iTunes and AirPlay sources, including
  iOS devices, Quicktime Player and third party sources such as forkedDaapd.
  Audio played by a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source
  and hence with similar devices playing the same source.

  Shairport Sync does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.
  Ensure Kernel Modules > Sound Support > kmod-sound-core is selected.
  Also select kmod-usb-audio if you want to use USB-connected sound cards.
